# :wave: Hello Automattic

This project is the page that I set up before applying for a role with [Automattic](https://automattic.com/).

I hosted it here at GitHub (using GitHub pages) and shared links to various sections in a more concise email version that I sent to [Automattic](https://automattic.com/)s `jobs@` address.

Thankfully my application was successful (:tada: :cake: :tada:), so I thought I'd share my material for anybody to peruse, especially for those thinking of taking the plunge!

We're always looking for awesome folk to join our adventure so don't be shy to check out our [Work With Us](https://automattic.com/work-with-us/) page and get in touch! :crossed_swords:
