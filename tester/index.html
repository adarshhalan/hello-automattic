			<h1>Why You?</h1>

			<p>UI is what I'm passionate about and is the reason I've been so heavily drawn to Javascript throughout my career - contributing to such widely used UIs &amp; helping to give the users a smoother experience would be extremely satisfying to me.</p>

			<p>Matt Mullenweg himself is another reason that I'm drawn to Automattic, I've watched a number of his interviews and find his attitude inspiring - it's a no-brainer that he is the kind of person I'd love to work for/with &amp; I trust that a lot of Automattitians will share this attitude.</p>

			<h1>Calypso &amp; OSS</h1>
			<p>I'd heard of Calypso a few times in the past year while researching WordPress theme projects built with React but recently started digging in to it as a means of learning more about React &amp; Redux.</p>
			<p>Being that Calypso is a huge app that is used by so many it seemed like the perfect 'deep end' to jump in to!
			I started to poke around and, to my surprise, found that there is a ton of room for myself to contribute - refactoring, adding unit tests, spotting &amp; fixing bugs and so on.</p>
			<p>It was super exciting to land my first PR and from that moment I've become hooked on OSS in general.
			I always consumed these projects, now I understand that I can give back too - it's incredible.
			The learning along the way is second to none - I've learnt so much in the past few months alone!</p>
