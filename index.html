				<h1 class="greeting pink covered">Hello Automattic!</h1>

				<p>I'm very happy to finally be getting in touch to express my interest in joining your team as a JavaScript Engineer!</p>
				<p>I've been planning to do so for some time now but wanted to really to learn more about some of the projects, technologies &amp; Automattic in general before doing so - everything that I have learned so far has only reassured me that you are a company that I'd love to play a part in!</p>

				<p>I'll start off by explaining why I would <a href="#why-you">love to work for you</a>, why I think I would make a <a href="#why-me">great addition to the team</a> and how <a href="#contributing">I'd like to help</a>.</p>
				<p>I'll then talk about <a href="#calypso-and-oss">Calypso &amp; OSS</a> in general, my thoughts on <a href="#on-remote-work">remote work &amp; the future of work</a>, and then finish up with some extra <a href="#more-about-me">bits &amp; bobs</a> about myself, including some <a href="#projects">sample projects</a> &amp; my journey in to the world of code.</p>

				<p>Thanks a bunch for even taking the time to read this far - I hope you enjoy the rest! :D</p>

					<p>I'd heard of Calypso a few times in the past year while researching WordPress theme projects built with React but recently started digging in to it as a means of learning more about React &amp; Redux.</p>
					<p>Being that Calypso is a huge app that is used by so many it seemed like the perfect 'deep end' to jump in to!
					I started to poke around and, to my surprise, found that there is a ton of room for myself to contribute - refactoring, adding unit tests, spotting &amp; fixing bugs and so on.</p>
					<p>It was super exciting to land my first PR and from that moment I've become hooked on OSS in general.
					I always consumed these projects, now I understand that I can give back too - it's incredible.
					The learning along the way is second to none - I've learnt so much in the past few months alone!</p>
