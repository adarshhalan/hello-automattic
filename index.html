					<h1 class="greeting pink covered">Hello Automattic!</h1>

					<p>I'm very happy to finally be getting in touch to express my interest in joining your team as a JavaScript Engineer!</p>
					<p>I've been planning to do so for some time now but wanted to really to learn more about some of the projects, technologies &amp; Automattic in general before doing so - everything that I have learned so far has only reassured me that you are a company that I'd love to play a part in!</p>

					<p>I'll start off by explaining why I would <a href="#why-you">love to work for you</a>, why I think I would make a <a href="#why-me">great addition to the team</a> and how <a href="#contributing">I'd like to help</a>.</p>
					<p>I'll then talk about <a href="#calypso-and-oss">Calypso &amp; OSS</a> in general, my thoughts on <a href="#on-remote-work">remote work &amp; the future of work</a>, and then finish up with some extra <a href="#more-about-me">bits &amp; bobs</a> about myself, including some <a href="#projects">sample projects</a> &amp; my journey in to the world of code.</p>

					<p>Thanks a bunch for even taking the time to read this far - I hope you enjoy the rest! üôè</p>

					<p>Automattic is a truly impressive company and there are a plethora of reasons for why anybody would want to call it home.</p>
					<p>I was originally attracted to Automattic for it's work philosophies, as I beleive the distributed workforce is a bit of a revolution of which Automattic is on the avant-garde.</p>	
					<p>I was also attracted to the scale and scope of impact of Automattic's products.</p>
					<p>I've met a huge number of people who, to some degree, have Automattic products to thank for enabling them to run their businesses from anywhere in the world and live the lifestyle they love. Some have built stores with WooCommerce, some are WordPress developers, some offer SEO or marketing services. I'd love the opportunity to help more people see the same benefits.</p>
					<p>More recently I've had the chance to speak with Automatticians, mostly through contributing to Calypso and each person has left a great impression on me. It's clear that there is somewhat of a shared attitude - to be helpful, friendly &amp; polite and to leave egos at the (proverbial) door.</p>
					<p>This is certainly my attitude and want to be surrounded by those who share this positive mindset!</p>
					<p>Matt Mullenweg himself is another reason that I'm drawn to Automattic, I've watched a number of his interviews and find his attitude inspiring - it's a no-brainer that he is the kind of person whose vision I'd want to support.</p>

				<p>I love what I do and still often feel like some crazy con-artist when I'm paid to write code.</p>

				<p>I treat code as a craft and as a result I'm a stickler for code craftsmanship. I'm always striving to find the most beautiful way to write code. I beleive that working towards well defined &amp; documented code styles is a worthy investment as it helps people to keep their focus on making logical decisions rather than syntactic ones.</p>

				<p>I'm increasingly appreciating the art of well documented software. Particularly in large OSS projects, strong documentation is a great way to help give context and show intent to those who are new to the project or touching an area of the codebase that is new to them, giving them the confidence to dive right in.</p>

				<p>I've read both the general and design creeds, both resonated with me. One line from the design creed that I particularly liked is: 'I will never stop at ‚Äúgood enough.‚Äù' I have my own version of this - "'Good enough' is just not good enough".</p>

				<p>I beleive myself to be a decent communicator, particularly online where communication can often be much trickier.</p>
				<p>Even in previous roles where I was working along side my colleuges I would encourage import conversations to be digital, rather than spoken so that the points covered were referencable by the whole team, including any future team members who might benefit from the added context.</p>
				<p>That said, I'm still learning and improving on my written communication and have been putting more focus on building my technical writing skills lately. Doing so has enabled me to write much better pull requests and have better participation in discussions on GitHub.</p>

			<div class="paper">
				<div class="copy">
				<p>Since I'm already contributing to Calypso and enjoying doing so, I'd love to be able to continue doing so full time - I thrive in large, complex projects where helping to make small decisions can have a large impact over all.</p>
				<p>Most of my contributions to date are more janitorial (I find these changes are best to help learn the current state of a project thats already in full swing) but I'm looking forward to helping with new features too, both by building out new features and proposing ideas of my own.</p>

				<p>I'd also play a part in expanding the reach of WordPress beyond it's already impressive numbers.</p>
				<p>I think that the developer experience for WordPress itself has a long way to go. I'm basing this on my own impressions and I may well have missed something along the way, but I think that certain areas could certainly be smoother and I'd like to eventually be able to offer up great ideas that help attract more developers to the platform.</p>
				<p>The idea of WordPress being used as an app platform strikes particular interest here as I feel thats an area a little improvement could make a huge a effect.</p>
				<p>Users come to expect more as the web evolves and javascript is playing an ever increasing role in delivering on those expectations.</p>

				<p>Another area that I'm quite interested in is theme development - specifically with more of a front-end focus.</p>
				<p>I'm currently in the process of converting my personal website from a front-end only SPA hosted on GitHub pages, to a self-hosted custom-themed WordPress install, built with a similar stack to Calypso (React, Redux etc.).  
				In the process of doing so I also plan to make the theme more generic to allow others to tweak and use the theme themselves.</p>
				<p>If I find the time, I'd also quite like to put a tutorial together to help others build similar themes themselves!</p>

					<p>I'd heard of Calypso a few times in the past year while researching WordPress theme projects built with React but recently started digging in to it as a means of learning more about React &amp; Redux.</p>
					<p>Being that Calypso is a huge app that is used by so many it seemed like the perfect 'deep end' to jump in to!
					I started to poke around and, to my surprise, found that there is a ton of room for myself to contribute - refactoring, adding unit tests, spotting &amp; fixing bugs and so on.</p>
					<p>It was super exciting to land my first PR and from that moment I've become hooked on OSS in general.
					I always consumed these projects, now I understand that I can give back too - it's incredible.
					The learning along the way is second to none - I've learnt so much in the past few months alone!</p>
